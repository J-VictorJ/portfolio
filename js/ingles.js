    starting my academic journey in 2022, previously, in 2021, I studied data bases with MySQL and programming language with Java. \
    These studies gave me a solid base to start System Develop and also to learn other programming languages <br><i>I'll talk more about it later.</i><br>\
    Since 2022 I've been studying and developing code, with a good part of it, in beggining, being simpler projects until I make this one, which I spent a good time on.\
    My linguistic journey also started in 2021, where I began with Italian and finally English. For the reason of the English is more multicultural I was able to learn more fluently.\
    I have also proeficience in spanish witch was a language that I learned "without wantint to". In summary I can say that these last two years have been extremly productive for my professional carrer,\
    I sought to learn programming with people from other countries, where I greatly expanded this part of logical and problem solving.`;
